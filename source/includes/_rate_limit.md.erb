# Rate Limit

By default, you can make up to 500 requests per minute. Requests are associated with the API key, and not with your IP address.

To keep the VideoPlasty API fast for everyone, requests must be cached for 24 hours. Also, the API is made for real human requests; do not send lots of automated queries. Systematic mass downloads are not allowed. If needed, we can increase this limit at any time - given that you've implemented the API properly.
